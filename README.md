# PHP Date Helper
Provides quick date formatting key in CLI.

Install with composer, global is ideal:

```
composer global require m1ke/date-helper
```

It's useful to have your composer global bin directory in your `$PATH`; the directory is usually: `$HOME/.composer/vendor/bin/`

If you have it in your `$PATH` you can run this from any command line with `php-date-helper`
